		<releaseNotes>Fixed and adjusted multiple areas of the user interface to better handle systems with high DPI enabled. Many new laptops are coming with HD screens that have a very large resolution and so their DPI is set very high to make programs and text readable. When this increase DPI was set many parts of the program didn't draw correctly. There are still a few areas that need adjusting but all the major ones have been fixed.</releaseNotes>
